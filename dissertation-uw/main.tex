% Options:
%   wip
%       Use draft mode.
%       It shows borders of the type center (for visual check of overflow),
%         sets large width for margin paragraphs, and
%         is suitable for two-sided draft printing.
%   no-bib-back-refs
%       Disable back references in bibliography.
%       This can be used to speed up typesetting drafts even if
%         the back references are desired in the final version.

% These three adjustments should be done before the table of contents.

\begin{document}

% The first two pages must be title and copyright,
% in arbitrary order.
\DissertationMakeTitlePage
\DissertationMakeCopyrightPage
% Takes data from "title.tex".

% The third thing must be abstract.
% If the abstract does not fit in one page,
% it will be numbered using Roman numerals.
\DissertationMakeAbstract
% Takes content from "abstract.tex".

% Pagination can be manually controlled using
\DissertationSkipPage
% after abstract.
% In the example content, abstract ends on page 4,
% and this makes dedication appear on page 6,
% followed by acknowledgments on page 7.
% This is a rather pleasant arrangement.

% The following things have arbitrary order:
% - dedication (optional)
% - acknowledgments (optional)
% - table of contents (mandatory) and friends (optional).
% ToCLoFT means "table of contents and friends".
% For ToCLoFT, table of contents must be the first,
% then list of figures and list of tables are optional
% and the two have no fixed order.
% However, all of them (if typeset) must be together,
% without dedication or acknowledgments interleaving.
% Interleaving with skipped pages is allowed.
% Examples:
% - allowed     D, ToC, A
% - allowed     ToC, LoF, A, D
% - allowed     ToC, skip, LoF, A, D
% - disallowed  D, ToC, A, LoT

% No parity affinity. Does not affect numbering.
\DissertationMakeDedicationPage
% Takes content from "dedicate.tex".

% Must be odd-numbered (right-hand). Use Roman numerals.
% \def\acknowledgename{Acknowledgements} % Change the title.
\DissertationMakeAcknowledgments
% Takes content from "acknowledge.tex".

% Must be odd-numbered (right-hand). Use Roman numerals.
\DissertationMakeTableOfContents

% No parity affinity.
\DissertationMakeListOfFigures

% No parity affinity.
\DissertationMakeListOfTables

% Once main text starts,
% none of dedication/acknowledgments/LoFT is allowed.
% This always starts on an odd-numbered (right-hand) page.
\DissertationStartMainText
