\section{Appendix and ``Supplementary Materials''}

Submissions to IACR area conferences are limited to 30 pages, and
anything in addition must be marked as ``supplementary materials''.
Usually we put details in the appendix and
change the name ``appendix'' to ``supplementary materials''
to make the IACR happy.

The reason that the deferred content must be named ``supplementary materials''
seems to arise from Springer.
In the camera-ready version,
Springer requires that the appendix, if any,
be included after the main body and before the bibliography.
I object to this ordering,
so I never include any appendix in my camera-ready.
Therefore, I have repurposed appendix in LNCS formats
solely for supplementary materials.
