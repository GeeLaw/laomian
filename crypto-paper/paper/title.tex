% \title:
%   The argument should be TeX code.
%   For multiline titles, it is important to have a space (" ")
%   before the line-break ("\\"). The space character ensures the
%   title in the PDF outline is correct. The similar rule applies
%   to section/subsection headings.
% \titlerunning:
%   The argument should be TeX code.
%   This is optional and sets the running title shown in the header
%   of every odd page. It is ignored unless the document is in LNCS
%   format and shows a running header.
%   It is advisable to always provide a suggestion.
%   If absent, Springer will work one out for you.
% \titlepdf:
%   The argument should be text.
%   This is optional and sets the title in PDF metadata.
%   It is ignored if the document is anonymous.
% \subjectpdf:
%   The argument should be text.
%   This is optional and sets the subject in PDF metadata.
%   It is ignored if the document is anonymous.

% \author:
%   The argument should be TeX code.
%   Multiple authors are separated by \and.
%   Use \inst and \orcidID. Springer puts \inst before \orcidID.
% \authorrunning:
%   The argument should be TeX code.
%   This is optional and sets the running author shown in the header
%   of every even page. It is ignored unless the document is in LNCS
%   format and shows a running header.
%   It is advisable to always provide a suggestion.
%   If absent, Springer will work one out for you.
%   The suggested style is
%     (1)  F.~Last
%     (2)  F.~Author and S.~Author
%     (3+) F.~Author, S.~Author, and T.~Author
%     (++) F.~Author \textit{et~al.}
%   However, Springer thinks 3 is already too many and
%   does not make "et al." italicized.
% \authorpdf:
%   The argument should be text.
%   This is optional and sets the author in PDF metadata.
%   It is ignored if the document is anonymous.
